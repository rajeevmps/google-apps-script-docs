# PromptResponse

A response to a prompt dialog displayed in the user-interface environment for a Google App.

A response to a prompt dialog displayed in the user-interface environment for a Google App. The response contains any text the user entered in the dialog's input field and indicates which button the user clicked to dismiss the dialog.

## Methods

### getResponseText() → String

Gets the text that the user entered in the dialog's input field. The text is available even if the user closed the dialog by clicking a button with a negative connotation, like "Cancel" or the close button in the dialog's title bar. `getSelectedButton()` can help to determine whether the user intended the response text to be valid.

**Return:** The text that the user entered in the dialog's input field.

### getSelectedButton() → Button

Gets the button that the user clicked to dismiss the dialog. If the user clicked the close button that is included in every dialog's title bar, this method returns `Button.CLOSE`.

**Return:** The button that the user clicked.

## Code Sample

```javascript
const ui = DocumentApp.getUi();
const response = ui.prompt(
    'Getting to know you',
    'May I know your name?',
    ui.ButtonSet.YES_NO,
);

if (response.getSelectedButton() === ui.Button.YES) {
  Logger.log('The user\'s name is %s.', response.getResponseText());
} else if (response.getSelectedButton() === ui.Button.NO) {
  Logger.log('The user didn\'t want to provide a name.');
} else {
  Logger.log('The user clicked the close button in the dialog\'s title bar.');
}
```
